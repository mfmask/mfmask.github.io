<!-- I apprached this the wrong way from the beginning and kept trying to adjust from one interation to the next, with no real ability to recover it in the end. I got frustrated and decided to try to redo for beginning.
I actually restarted the whole project on another index file (index2.html) I have added to folder. It is an effort at project again with new style sheet (style2.css) I have a better understanding of positioning now, but no time to finish.
I am looking forward to seeing the solved code to see an optimal way to do this project.-->

<!-- I finally got the nav bar to position right in header, but having issues styling it to look like model. I have tried to renamed class and ID tags to no avail. When I try to adjust it, I break the site too much. I really should have appraoched this differently as a whole. -->
